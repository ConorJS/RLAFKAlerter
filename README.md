# Visual AFK Alerter (Movement only)
Gives a visual indicator when your character stops moving. 

This can be useful if you're training skills (or doing some other activity) 
involving constant movement, such as Agility or Runecrafting, especially if the game is on a side monitor.

The game window will glow a color (configurable). You can also configure the speed of 
the glow effect, and how long your character needs to stand still for the 
alert to trigger. You can also configure a separate alert window when the character
is at a bank (to compensate for extra time banking takes compared to just moving your character)
